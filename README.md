## Introduction

OCR = Optical Character Recognition. In other words, OCR systems transform a two-dimensional image of text, that could contain machine printed or handwritten text from its image representation into machine-readable text. OCR as a process generally consists of several sub-processes to perform as accurately as possible. The subprocesses are:

- Preprocessing of the Image
- Text Localization
- Character Segmentation
- Character Recognition
- Post Processing

The sub-processes in the list can differ, but these are roughly steps needed to approach automatic character recognition. In OCR software, itâ€™s main aim to identify and capture all the unique words using different languages from written text characters.

For almost two decades, optical character recognition systems have been widely used to provide automated text entry into computerized systems. Yet in all this time, conventional online OCR systems (like zonal OCR) have never overcome their inability to read more than a handful of type fonts and page formats. Proportionally spaced type (which includes virtually all typeset copy), laser printer fonts, and even many non-proportional typewriter fonts, have remained beyond the reach of these systems. And as a result, conventional OCR has never achieved more than a marginal impact on the total number of documents needing conversion into digital form.

Optical Character Recognition remains a challenging problem when text occurs in unconstrained environments, like natural scenes, due to geometrical distortions, complex backgrounds, and diverse fonts. The technology still holds an immense potential due to the various use-cases of deep learning based OCR like

## Tesseract OCR

Tesseract is an open source text recognition (OCR) Engine, available under the Apache 2.0 license. It can be used directly, or (for programmers) using an API to extract printed text from images. It supports a wide variety of languages. Tesseract doesn't have a built-in GUI, but there are several available from the 3rdParty page. Tesseract is compatible with many programming languages and frameworks through wrappers that can be found here. It can be used with the existing layout analysis to recognize text within a large document, or it can be used in conjunction with an external text detector to recognize text from an image of a single text line.

Tesseract 4.00 includes a new neural network subsystem configured as a text line recognizer. It has its origins in OCRopus' Python-based LSTM implementation but has been redesigned for Tesseract in C++. The neural network system in Tesseract pre-dates TensorFlow but is compatible with it, as there is a network description language called Variable Graph Specification Language (VGSL), that is also available for TensorFlow.

To recognize an image containing a single character, we typically use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Text of arbitrary length is a sequence of characters, and such problems are solved using RNNs and LSTM is a popular form of RNN. Read this post to learn more about LSTM.




### Preprocessing of images using OpenCV

Basic functions for different preprocessing methods 
- grayscaling
- thresholding
- dilating
- eroding
- opening
- canny edge detection
- noise removal
- deskwing
- template matching. 



### Bounding box information using Pytesseract

While running and image through the tesseract OCR engine, pytesseract allows to get bounding box imformation 
- on a character level
- on a word level
- based on a regex template



### Page Segmentation Modes

There are several ways a page of text can be analysed. The tesseract api provides several page segmentation modes to run OCR on only a small region or in different orientations, etc.

Here's a list of the supported page segmentation modes by tesseract. 

0    Orientation and script detection (OSD) only.  
1    Automatic page segmentation with OSD.  
2    Automatic page segmentation, but no OSD, or OCR.  
3    Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD. (Default)  
4    Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.  
5    Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.  
6    Assume a single uniform block of text.  
7    Treat the image as a single text line.  
8    Treat the image as a single word.  
9    Treat the image as a single word in a circle.  
10    Treat the image as a single character.  
11    Sparse text. Find as much text as possible in no particular order.  
12    Sparse text with OSD.  
13    Raw line. Treat the image as a single text line, bypassing hacks that are Tesseract-specific.  



### Playing around with the config

By making minor changes in the config file you can 
- specify language
- detect only digits
- whitelist characters
- blacklist characters
- work with multiple language
